I created this game for my fall 2022 German class at Tufts. 

The game centers around a 1929 novel "Emil Und Die Detektiv", and functions as a kind of quiz. 

In this quiz, I pose questions relating back to specific moments from the chapter entitled "Emil besucht das Politzeiprasidium".

The game itself allows players to work in 1-5 teams, where each team can specify their name. 


Fun drawings of small and large ASCII trains reinforce the novel's themes, and are also just delightful to see :)
